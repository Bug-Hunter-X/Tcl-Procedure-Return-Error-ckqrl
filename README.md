This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in Tcl: incorrect usage of the `return` command within a procedure. The `badproc.tcl` file shows the erroneous code, while `badprocSolution.tcl` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from the implicit return of the last evaluated expression when return is not explicitly used in all branches of a conditional statement. This can lead to unexpected results and difficult-to-debug issues, especially in complex procedures.
